# CanonicalLogs

Inspired by the [legendary Stripe blog post](https://stripe.com/blog/canonical-log-lines), this library consolidates your Plug/Phoenix/Absinthe request logs into a single log line with all of their relevant information for easier querying.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `canonical_logs` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:canonical_logs, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/canonical_logs>.
